A Capstone Project on Facebook Posts to Members Reaction

# Statistics_MA5820_Capstone
 For the Facebook page (Anonymous Association), is there a relation between   posts vs members being active in the group? (Linear Regression Model buildup from scratch)

The study was done to get an overview on how the members are reacting to
the posts and how they are interacting with the group which was created
with the intention of people helping each other in the community. The
purpose of the report emphasised the statistical study of the
association between the posts and members in the Facebook page. The
results from the report can help to understand the steps that are needed
to improve and enhance the interactivity among the group with a focus on
the posts.

The data is obtained for study and understanding purposes with
observational units about dates, total members, posts, comments and
active members on any given day. None of the information about the
user's profiles is retained.

The statistical study was done on a sample of 40 days which are picked
using the principles of simple random sample and analysed with a
***two-fold hypothesis test***.

> -   The ***first hypothesis*** is tested on the correlation between
>     the posts and members.

> -   The ***second hypothesis*** was done to test the slope of
>     ***linear regression data*** not equal to zero and to check a
>     linear association between posts and active members.

A correlation test is conducted on comments and active members to see
any association to ***check for a confounding*** variable. A correlation
test performed using the Pearson correlation test yielded a medium to a
strong correlation between the posts and the members, rejecting the null
hypothesis. The second test rejected the null hypothesis supporting the
slope or multiplicative $β_{1}$ in the regression as it is not equal to
zero. The **R²** showed a medium to strong relation between posts and
active members.
